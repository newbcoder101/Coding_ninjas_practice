          As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get overwhelming at times.
          You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing, workflow, dependency management, performance, 
          optimization, build, deployment, and so on. Doesn’t sound easy, right?

       <p>“refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality.
          This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, your 
          code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. Apart from 
          that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your code 
          remains free from plagiarism.</p>

      <p> It is a standard convention among developers to use GUI tools to power the terminal. 
          What most of them don’t realize is that by doing so, they end up spending a significant portion of 
          their valuable time in handling GUI tools than making progress on the terminal. The right way to go 
          about it is learning the command line. Start with the basics of the command line and advance to higher
           levels as you go, and you’ll find that you can complete several tasks with much more ease and efficiency
            with command line tools than with GUI tools. Moreover, automating the terminal with appropriate 
            commands is a great way to save time and energy.
